I actually got to watch some movies last month. My five month old and two year
old made sure that I couldn't watch any of them in a single sitting,
but at least I got to see them! (and I wouldn't change being a parent for the
world):

The movies:

- `Argo <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1024648/>`_ - Spy thrillers can be hit
  and miss but this was really engrossing. I didn't know the historical outcome so the movie held me all the more. p.s.: Ben Affleck has the coolest beard.
- `Source Code <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945513/>`_ - A engaging
  time-travel thriller. It had a few plot holes but nothing that detracted
  from the entertainment at all. Don't think too hard as you watch it and I think you'll it. I did.
 
And the best reading of the month:

- `Folklore - Andy Hertzfeld <http://www.folklore.org/index.py>`_ - Life inside a start-up. Making history might be fun, but it's generally hard work. The background behind the hardware was fascinating, and took me back to 1990.
- `Michael Lewis - Obama's Way <http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama>`_ - It's Michael Lewis. What's not to like? Just read it.
- `Sci-Fi Structures Found on Earth Get Transported to Alien World <http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2013/03/adam-ryder-ancient-sci-fi/>`_ - Some people are incredibly creative. I'd happily move into Atmospheric observation outpost Omicron (the third picture) - hopefully one will appear for sale in my local real-estate agent.
- `The Real Cuban Missile Crisis <http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/01/the-real-cuban-missile-crisis/309190/?single_page=true>`_ - I didn't realise that my view of the crisis was so heavily influenced by the writings of a pro-Kennedy hawk. Bias is most dangerous when you don't even realise it's there.

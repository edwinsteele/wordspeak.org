I made my first open source contribution today and I'm pretty stoked. The change itself is almost inconsequential (<https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/pull/245>) but there have been a series of events that have helped me get here, including:

-   rediscovering my love for writing code (thanks Preet Kukreti)
-   deciding to publish my code after reading Fredrik Haard's [Dare to show your code](https://dzone.com/articles/rant-dare-show-your-code)
-   learning git (and the GitHub workflow)
-   Hynek Schlawack's [My Road to the Python Commit Bit](https://hynek.me/articles/my-road-to-the-python-commit-bit/)
-   Jesse Noller's [Why aren't you contributing (To Python)](http://jessenoller.com/2010/04/22/why-arent-you-contributing-to-python)
-   The last [python bug day](http://blog.python.org/2012/10/python-bug-day-this-saturday.html) and while I didn't make any changes, I looked for tasks and got everything setup and got in that "I really want to do this" headspace

Sometimes it's hard to see how a sequence of little steps set you up for what's ahead. Here's to another little step, and to what's ahead.

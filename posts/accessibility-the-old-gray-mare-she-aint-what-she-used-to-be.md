My eyes aren't getting any better as the years pass, and so I'm more aware of things that improve website usability for those who don't have awesome vision or who read the web through a screen-reader.

I've recently improved the accessibility of this site by increasing the contrast of page elements and providing better information for a screen reader (removed redundant information and added it where it was missing).

If you're wanting to improve the accessibility of your site (and it'd be great if you did), you'll get some practical, easy-to-implement guidance from the Accessibility section of Chrome's [Lighthouse audit tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) and from WebAIM's [WAVE tool](http://wave.webaim.org). Even if you pick a few higher priority suggestions and come back to the others, it'll be an improvement for someone with reduced vision who reads your site. _Future you_ says thanks.

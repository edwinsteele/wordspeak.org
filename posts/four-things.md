The content and spread of this fun "Four Things" post is most interesting. I first saw it at [Eric Meyer's site](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/01/24/four-things/) but it's right throughout the web development community. Has anyone studied the [phylogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogeny) of these contagious little chronicles?

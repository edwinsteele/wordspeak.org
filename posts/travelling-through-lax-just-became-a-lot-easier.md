I've transited Los Angeles Airport for many years on my way to conferences and family visits and on a recent trip I was thrilled to find that its no longer necessary to go through airport security when moving between international to domestic flights. While the signposting is pretty bad, one can now move between Tom Bradley International and Terminal 4 (and thus the rest of the domestic terminals) without exiting the terminal and subjecting oneself, and ones family, to security screening and potential delays.

Hooray.

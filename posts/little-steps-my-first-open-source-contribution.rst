I made my first open source contribution today and I'm pretty stoked. The change itself is almost inconsequential (https://github.com/ralsina/nikola/pull/245) but there have been a series of events that have helped me get here, including:

* rediscovering my love for writing code (thanks Preet Kukreti)
* deciding to publish my code after reading Fredrik Haard's `Dare to show your code <http://css.dzone.com/articles/rant-dare-show-your-code>`_
* learning git (and the github workflow)
* Hynek Schlawack's `My Road to the Python Commit Bit <http://hynek.me/articles/my-road-to-the-python-commit-bit/>`_
* Jesse Noller's `Why aren't you contributing (To Python) <http://jessenoller.com/2010/04/22/why-arent-you-contributing-to-python>`_
* The last `python bug day <http://blog.python.org/2012/10/python-bug-day-this-saturday.html>`_ and while I didn't make any changes, I looked for tasks and got everything setup and got in that "I really want to do this" headspace

Sometimes it's hard to see how a sequence of little steps set you up for what's ahead. Here's to another little step, and to what's ahead.

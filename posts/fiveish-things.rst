Deeper than the average answer (because they're deeper than the average question).
Presenting `Five(ish) Things I Don't Know About You
<http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/12/fiveish_things_.html>`_:

1: What's the most fun work you've ever done, and why?
	Work - Building or re-engineering a system or a piece of software (more "satisfying" than "fun", though)

2a: Name one thing you did in the past that you no longer do but wish you did?
	Kicking a soccer ball in the street with friends -- simple, hassle-free fun.

2b: Name one thing you've always wanted to do but keep putting it off?
	Driving or riding REALLY, REALLY fast and living in Russia, France or Italy (I get two, I'm writing here!)

3a: What two things would you most like to learn or be better at, and why?
	Telling others about Jesus (what could be greater than seeing a life truly changed?), Russian language (facilitating a fuller and more relaxing experience when I move there)

3b: If you could take a class/workshop/apprentice from anyone in the world living or dead, who would it be and what would you hope to learn?
	St Francis of Assisi (living and appreciating a simple life) or Condoleezza Rice (Competence, determination through adversity and integrity in political affairs)

4a: What three words might your best friends or family use to describe you?
	Sensitive, astute, committed

4b: Now list two more words you wish described you...
	Courageous, selfless

5: What are your top three passions? (can be current or past, work, hobbies, or causes)
	My friends, rock climbing & knowing, loving and serving God

6: Write--and answer--one more question that YOU would ask someone
	Q: What are you going to do with your answers to these questions? A: Write down some "next actions" for improvement and achievement so you won't come up with the same answers in 5 years

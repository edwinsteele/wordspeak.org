Last month I moved from having a dynamic `WordPress <http://wordpress.org>`_ blog to having a statically built blog generated by `Nikola <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`_. I wanted to preserve the wordpress-style post and rss URLs when I migrated and while I could have manually created `redirections <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar/handbook.html#redirections>`_ within Nikola, I thought I could do better through webserver directives.

My WordPress installation generated posts URLs in the form ``http://wordspeak.org/yyyy/mm/dd/some_post_name``. After using the WordPress importer in Nikola, that post now exists at ``http://wordspeak.org/posts/yyyymmddsome_post_name.html``. I noticed that Apache RewriteRules didn't play nicely with the relative paths that Nikola generates but I found I could achieve what I wanted with the Redirect family of directives. 

Here's a snippet of my apache ``.htaccess`` file to handle these redirections.

Hopefully someone will find this valuable.

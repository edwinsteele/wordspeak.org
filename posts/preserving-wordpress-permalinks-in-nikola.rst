Last month I moved from having a dynamic `WordPress <http://wordpress.org>`_
blog to having a statically built blog generated by `Nikola <http://getnikola.com>`_. I wanted to preserve the WordPress-style post and RSS URLs when I migrated and while I could have manually created `redirections <http://getnikola.com/handbook.html#redirections>`_ within Nikola, I thought I could do better through web server directives.

My WordPress installation generated posts URLs in the form ``http://wordspeak.org/yyyy/mm/dd/some_post_name``. After using the WordPress importer in Nikola, that post now exists at ``http://wordspeak.org/posts/yyyymmddsome_post_name.html``. I noticed that Apache RewriteRules didn't play nicely with the relative paths that Nikola generates but I found I could achieve what I wanted with the Redirect family of directives. 

Here's a snippet of my Apache ``.htaccess`` file to handle these redirections.

.. code-block:: apacheconf

	RedirectMatch permanent ^/([0-9]{4})/([0-9]{2})/([0-9]{2})/([a-z][-a-z0-9]*)$ /posts/$1$2$3$4.html
	# /feed /feed/ /feed/rss /feed?=http://wordspeak.org
	RedirectMatch permanent ^/feed /rss.xml
	RedirectPermanent /rss /rss.xml

Hopefully someone will find this valuable.

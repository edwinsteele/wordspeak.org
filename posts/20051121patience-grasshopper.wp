<html><body><p>One step at a time.</p>

<p>I'm always fighting the desire to have <u>everything perfect</u> before even starting but here I just want enough infrastructure to publish, be happy enough with the look and have a starting point for improvements.</p>



Here's the basic todo list:

<ol><li>Actually get a basic wordpress and gallery2 install [ka-ching]</li>

<li>Move the content across from my old zeta site (<a href="http://www.zeta.org.au/~ed">http://www.zeta.org.au/~ed</a>), particularly image galleries and Quicktime VR panoramas [ka-ching]</li>

<li>Sort out and upload the rest of the image galleries [done]</li>

<li>Upload the first cut at my wordpress template [done]</li>

<li>Tie in the wordpress and gallery templates via the wordpress gallery2 plugin (<a href="http://wpg2.ozgreg.com">http://wpg2.ozgreg.com</a>) [done] </li>

<li>Write! [ ‚Üê Now I'm here ]</li>

</ol>



I've already got several image galleries in place. You can see them by following the Photos link at the top right of this page.



Cheers,

Edwin.</body></html>

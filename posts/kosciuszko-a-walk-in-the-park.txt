Mt. Kosciuszko is Australia's highest mountain. If you are planning the trip,
I suggest you leave behind your supplemental oxygen, your ice axe and your
duck-down suit. Your best friend would be a good old can of Aerogard. The
flies are really bad.

Between Christmas and New Year's, a friend and I drove from Sydney, past
Canberra and up into the Snowy Mountains. After a good night's sleep we
continued past the ski fields and drove as far as we could until the road
stopped at Charlotte's Pass. 2 hours and a 9km walk later we stood heroically,
windswept and a little sunburnt, a full 2229m (7313ft) above sea level
surveying all the land and people of Australia beneath us... at least until
the next person stood next to the summit marker! Taking a different route back
lead us past beautiful alpine scenery, a glacial lake and some wildflowers
that grow in one place worldwide -- along the track we walked. The 13km return
leg was tiring but ever so beautiful. Take a day out if you're in the area in
summer.

Now, would it surprise you that I took photos? Honestly, I'm really thrilled
with the way these came out. I'm especially fond of the jpg panoramas (and the
zoomable Quicktime QTVR versions aren't bad either!). All the photos and jpg
panoramas are in my `Kosciuszko <http://www.flickr.com/photos/edwin_steele/sets/72157632562706220/>`_ album.

Oh, ok. Here's a taste...

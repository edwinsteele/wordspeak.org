The [Rural Fire Service](http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au) are amazing. We've had temperatures in the mid-30 degrees Celsius, winds gusting up to 100km/h and humidity below 20% and they've worked incredibly hard to protect people and properties. Thank you. Please [support them](http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_content.cfm?cat_id=4541) or consider joining up.

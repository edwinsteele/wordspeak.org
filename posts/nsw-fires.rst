The `Rural Fire Service <http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au>`_ are amazing. We've had temperatures in the mid-30 degrees Celsius, winds gusting up to 100km/h and humidity below 20% and they've worked incredibly hard to protect people and properties. Thank you. Please `support them <http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/dsp_content.cfm?cat_id=4541>`_ or consider joining up.

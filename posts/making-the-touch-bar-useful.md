I've had a touch-bar equipped Macbook Pro for about 6 months. While the touch-id sensor gets regular use, I'd entirely disregarded the rest of the touch bar. It didn't do anything useful and actually proved to be a step backwards for adjusting sound and brightness (I find buttons more useful than sliders). I recently read [Making the Touch Bar finally useful](http://vas3k.com/blog/touchbar/) and discovered how [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) can be used to customise the touch bar. Here's my new touch bar:

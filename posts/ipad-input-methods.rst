My iPad is a wonderful tool, and while I read a lot of material on it I also
use it to compose emails, take notes and take meeting minutes. While the iPad
on-screen keyboard is useful for small input tasks, particularly if you have a way to
stabilise the screen, I've found that other input methods are helpful in certain
situations.

Siri
----
I snickered at Siri's foibles when it was released but it's definitely improved
over time. I find Siri useful when I'm on my own and I want to dictate notes or
dump ideas and don't care about formatting or correct
spelling. I find myself using Siri while I'm walking, which is a situation where
I can't edit documents effectively anyway and most of the time it'll do a good
job of capturing my ideas so that I can incorporate them later into a more structured
document (I dictated the key ideas for this blog post via Siri while I
was walking to the train station).

Stylus
------
I learnt to use a stylus when I had a `Palm M500 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_m500_series>`_ and I found it quite an
effective input method, and faster than a touch-screen keyboard. On the iPad
I use `MyScript Notes <http://www.visionobjects.com/en/myscript/note-taking-and-forms-applications/myscript-notes-mobile/ios/>`_,
with a  `Kensington Virtuoso <http://www.kensington.com/kensington/us/us/v/3270/1509/virtuoso%E2%84%A2-stylus-and-pen-for-tablets-.aspx>`_ stylus
and it's working well for me.
MyScript Notes has very good handwriting recognition and a number of easy
gestures to erase and move text which help with the iPad's inability to easily
edit text (my finger always makes it hard to place the cursor when I want to
correct a spelling mistake). It also exports the text to other applications but
I see that as a workaround because it's an App and not a system-wide service
, like it was on the Palm Pilot. I do wish stylus input were available
for all applications in the way that Siri is; I can live in hope.
There are other iOS applications that support stylus input, including
Penultimate, but they didn't have the features that I was looking for. There are
reviews out there that compare them, so I won't bother [#]_.

External Keyboards
------------------
I find typing and editing with a physical keyboard to be a much better experience
than using the on-screen keyboard. I use a spare Apple Bluetooth job that we had
lying around but there are also keyboards that are
integrated into the case like the `Logitech Ultrathin <http://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/ultrathin-keyboard-cover>`_
which makes transport easier. I prefer a full-sized keyboard, and I'm
really fond of my `Portenzo BookCase <http://shop.portenzo.com/bookcase-for-ipad/>`_ case so I'm happy to lug
an extra device for the times that I plan to do a bunch of typing, at least until
something better comes along!

In summary
----------
It makes no sense for me to recommend one method over another as it all depends
on your usage patterns. I use them all, and exploring others is fun too!

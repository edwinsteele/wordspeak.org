A poorly scoped upgrade to my hosting left me without an easy way to publish until I rebuilt the entire world... entirely... and stuff. More on that later. In the meantime here's my favourite reading from the last two months.

-   [Ars Technica - Anatomy of a hack: How crackers ransack passwords like “qeadzcwrsfxv1331”](http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/) - You'll be amazed how easily your carefully chosen passwords are cracked; Enjoy the read, then get a password manager and have it create strong passwords for you. Mac users can do worse than [1Password](https://1password.com) (I use it)
-   [Hayley Campbell - My Life As An Amateur Taxidermist](http://www.newstatesman.com/art-and-design/2013/06/my-life-amateur-taxidermist-or-how-i-ended-my-pyjamas-3pm-awaiting-delivery-t) - I laughed so hard that I cried (while on public transport).
-   [Kieran Healy - Using Metadata To Find Paul Revere](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/) - How an expert can draw conclusions from a seemingly trivial data set. A case-in-point why I don't have a Google account and don't do Facebook. And the article helped me find out who Paul Revere is.
-   [Geoffrey Pullum - Speech Recognition vs. Language Processing](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2013/05/23/speech-recognition-vs-language-processing/) and [Machine Translation Without the Translation](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2013/05/31/machine-translation/) - Great (and sometimes humorous) analysis on why text and language processing is useful in limited areas but is still far from perfect.
-   [Antonio Mendez - Master of Disguise](http://www.themasterofdisguise.com/books/the-master-of-disguise) - A retired CIA agent tells interesting stories from his career, including the story on which the movie Argo was based. The first few chapters were a little slow, but it was very engaging from then on.
-   [Michael Finkel (National Geographic) - Australia's Aboriginals](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/06/aboriginal-australians/finkel-text) - Life in a remote Aboriginal town; wonderful and saddening at the same time. Support [Indigenous Literacy Day](http://www.indigenousliteracyfoundation.org.au/indigenous-literacy-day.html) on September 4.

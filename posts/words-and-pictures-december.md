Reading:

-   [Professor, You're Dividing My Nation](http://chronicle.com/article/Professor-Youre-Dividing-My/139893/) - Sophie Hardach (Chronicle Review). The political complexities in defining a national language (in this case, Kurdish). If you enjoyed the Urdu piece last month, you'll enjoy this too.
-   [Pursuing the Platypus](http://idlewords.com/2013/12/pursuing_the_platypus.htm) - Maciej Ceg≈Çowski. A funny and entertaining narrative that introduces you to Australia's native fauna as the author has a holiday in Queensland.
-   [Stuxnet's Secret Twin](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/11/19/stuxnets-secret-twin/) - Ralph Langner (Foreign Policy). A very readable technical explanation of how Stuxnet damaged the Iranian nuclear program. (Reading in Instapaper bypasses the free registration requirement)
-   [How the Bitcoin protocol actually works](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/) - Michael Nielsen. Informative and easy to follow. It's technical, but if you understand public key cryptography and cryptographic hashing, you'll be fine.
-   [Threat Vector](http://www.tomclancy.com/book_display.php?isbn13=9780399160455) - Tom Clancy with Mark Greaney. I read this on holidays and had low expectations after seeing Tom Clancy's quality decline in the last decade, but I was pleasantly surprised. The combat sections are top-notch, as usual, but in this case the plot was quite reasonable and not wrecked by unnecessary sex.

Watching:

-   [The Amazing Race, Season 23](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Race_23) - After all these seasons, it's still a great way to veg out after work.

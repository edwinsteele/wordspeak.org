It seems I process photos in fits and starts. I'd like to say that I got
inspired to do this batch but the truth is that I was bored of all the other
activities that were within reach, work was intense and I needed to do
something, anything to get my head away from planning technical changes,
people management issues and whether my team was getting through enough work,
and the right work to keep our traders happy.

So I sat down to sort, sequence, prune and geotag the photos from our time in
Chicago. As is often the case, the memories flood back, the details resurface
from the depths of one's mind, the travel sites are loaded and the planning
for (or is it dreaming of?) the next trip commences.

Here's the result. I hope you like it: http://www.flickr.com/photos/edwin_steele/sets/72157632566695478/

<html><body><p>I've not done a whole lot of outdoor climbing (everyone's a gym climber unless they know and trust someone who has gear!) and these two days just left me wanting a whole lot more. Barrenjoey Heads is on the northern beaches of Sydney and contains plenty of beginner-intermediate grade sport (pre-placed bolts and protection) and traditional climbs (place and remove your own as you go). Most of the routes are in the difficulty range of 10-22 (US 5.5-5.11b) making them a great place to find your feet climbing outdoors. We found Boxing Day to be a little crowded but the bucketing rain early on New Years Day seemed to discourage just about everyone which meant we had practically the whole (dry) crag to ourselves.



I present to you the photos, starring Jono, Chris B, Chris C, Naomi, Damien, Edwin and Harold the lizard:

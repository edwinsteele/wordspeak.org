This link shows a [panorama taken on Mars](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/m/news/news.php?release=2014-157). Stop and let that sink in.

This was ***taken on Mars***.

I'm amazed that this is happening in my lifetime, and hope that the sense of amazement doesn't fade as we continue to do incredible things.

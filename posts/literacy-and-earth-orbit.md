[The Thing That Goes Beep](http://blog.crone.su/2015/08/the-thing-that-goes-beep.html) shows the amazing progress that the Soviets made in the 20th century.

> The Imperial Russian 1897 Population Census counted the percentage of literate people in all Russia as 28.4%.
...
In 1926, the literacy program was not performing as well as the Soviets expected. Only 51% of the population over the age of ten was now literate.
...
According to the 1939 Soviet Census, 89.7% of people between the ages of 9 and 49 were literate. During the 1950s, the Soviet Union would achieve a near 100% literacy rate.

And then this...

> On April 12, 1961, the spacecraft Vostok 1 was launched. At this point, putting things in space was routine for a nation where the population remembered not being able to read.

Putting someone into Earth Orbit is amazing but the achievement is mind-blowing given the foundation.

As a Westerner, I find it fascinating to hear patriotic stories from a Soviet perspective.

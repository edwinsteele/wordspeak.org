While cleaning up a few old Evernote folders I came across a few partly written posts, including this one with some of my favourite articles from 2014. I know... 2014 is *so* last year, but the articles are still good.

* [Paint the Earth - Randall Munroe (XKCD)](http://what-if.xkcd.com/84/): a great example of how order-of-magnitude thinking can help with seemingly overwhelming questions. XKCD *What if* articles are so much fun.
* [Nobody's Son - Mark Slouka (New Yorker)](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/01/nobodys-son.html): My Dad died a few years ago. The author's Dad died and he wrote this beautiful, honest, confused and touching piece.
* [How to speed up your computer using Google Drive as extra RAM - Andrew Brown](http://drusepth.net/how-to-speed-up-your-computer-using-google-drive-as-extra-ram/): So well written, and utterly hilarious.
* [A field report from malaria’s cradle of drug resistance - Ed Young (Ars Technica)](http://arstechnica.com/science/2014/03/a-field-report-from-malarias-cradle-of-drug-resistance/): *"Victories in malaria are often short-lived"*. It's fascinating to understand how we fight Malaria, and horrible that it still affects so many people.
* [Game of Thrones - David Owen (New Yorker)](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/04/21/140421fa_fact_owen): Listening to an expert speak in their field is almost always an interesting experience. This guy is an expert on aircraft seat design and the article is ever so interesting.
* [Diary: “Sh-t, I’ve Had A Stroke” - Geoff Dyer (London Review Of Books)](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n07/geoff-dyer/diary): Insight into what it's like to have a stroke. Someone close to me had multiple strokes, so this helps me understand their world just a little more.
* [The Internet With A Human Face - Beyond Tellerrand 2014 Conference Talk - Maciej Cegłowski](http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm): *"The Internet remembers too much"*. It didn't need to be this way, but now that it is, what can we do? 
* [Hug Some Concrete - Bill Gates](http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Making-the-Modern-World): On scarcity, efficiency and consumption. I think Bill Gates is awesome.
* [Dixie Zen - Sam Anderson (Oxford American)](http://www.oxfordamerican.org/magazine/item/201-dixie-zen): Riding truck tyre inner-tubes down a river in Louisiana. So relaxing.
* [Ejection Site: Fastest Man on Earth - John Paul Stapp](http://www.ejectionsite.com/stapp.htm): 46Gs, rocket sleds and seat belts. What a trailblazer. What courage.
* [The Man With The Golden Blood - Greg White](http://mosaicscience.com/story/man-golden-blood): The life of a universal donor and the mechanics of blood transfusions. So interesting.
* [Zero Hour - Johanna Scutts (Lapham's Quarterly)](http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/zero-hour): The development of timepieces and the wristwatch.
* [Green Honey - Muyueh Lee](http://muyueh.com/greenhoney/): Graphically testing the theory that *"Different languages have different ways to describe color"*. This is a really clever use of data, and beautifully done. Do view this on the site, rather than using Instapaper or a reading application.

I saw a movie in November. A whole movie with only a few interruptions from the kids. Amazing! I hope to do the same in 2014.

Reading:

* `Designing Offline-First Web Apps <http://alistapart.com/article/offline-first>`_ - Alex Feyerke (A List Apart). As a daily commuter with spotty mobile coverage, I appreciate when application developers take the time to consider "offline" as a valid state and not an error.
* `More And Better Nuclear Power <http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/11/difference-engine-0>`_ - Nicholas Val√©ry (The Economist). I'm pro-nuclear, and would love to see old, unsafe light-water reactors replaced with new, safe models (often using Thorium fuel), that can make this a safe and effective power source.
* `The art of stealing <http://www.nrc.nl/kunsthal-en/>`_ - Lex Boon (NRC). The story of a major art heist in Rotterdam. Beautifully formatted - read this on the site instead of in Instapaper.
* `The Great Discontent: Merlin Mann <http://thegreatdiscontent.com/merlin-mann>`_ - Tina Essmaker (TGD). I really like Merlin Mann. He's honest, funny and he's well read in more areas than one might expect given his exposure in the tech/productivity world. This is a great interview.


Pictures:
* `Pacific Rim <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Rim_(film)>`_ - MechWarrior comes to life. What an absolute cracker!
* `Sanna Dullaway injects colour into historic photographs <http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2088611/Swedish-artist-Sanna-Dullaway-injected-colour-host-historic-photographs.html>`_ - John Hutchinson (Daily Mail). These photos seem more relevant and accessible when viewed in colour, even though they speak volumes in their original form.

My employer is hiring in Shanghai, so I did a quick trip to conduct a bunch of interviews. The food was sensational. The pollution... not so much. Here are a few of my favourite photos (click through for the full size on Flickr).

A view from the office on a relatively unpolluted day. The fine particulate matter reading, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, was 90μg/m<sup>3</sup> when this photo was taken.

The same view 2 days later, with PM<sub>2.5</sub> at 146μg/m<sup>3</sup>. It peaked at 271μg/m<sup>3</sup> with a corresponding Air Quality Index of [321](https://twitter.com/CGShanghaiAir/status/562977673056886784). This level is deemed [Hazardous](http://shanghai.usembassy-china.org.cn/airmonitor.html) - _"Everyone should avoid all physical activity outdoors; people with heart or lung disease, older adults, and children should remain indoors and keep activity levels low"_. Ugh...

A panorama from the Bund, looking back to downtown Pudong.

The [Shanghai Maglev Train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Maglev_Train), just before we boarded. We caught a _slow_ service, which ran at 300 km/h; the fast service runs at 431km/h. I loved the ride.

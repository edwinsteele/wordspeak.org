Words and Pictures for August? It's November! 

I know. I've been doing other things, yet these articles were too good not to share.

Reading:

* `Have You Heard The One About President Joe Biden? <http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201308/joe-biden-presidential-campaign-2016-2013?printable=true>`_ - Jeanne Marie Laskas (GQ). Joe Biden sounds like a politician who isn't a Politician. Great writing - it made me feel like I was travelling with him.
* `Arabic: A Language With Too Many Armies And Navies <http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/06/arabic>`_ - The Economist. An introduction to Arabic dialects. Technical enough to be interesting yet accessible to monoglots or infant polyglots like me.
* `In Praise Of Laziness <http://www.economist.com/news/business/21583592-businesspeople-would-be-better-if-they-did-less-and-thought-more-praise-laziness>`_ - Schumpeter (The Economist). Knowledge workers need physical and mental space for creativity.
* `Forced Exposure <http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20130818120421175>`_ - Groklaw. I read this as the seriousness of the Edward Snowden leaks was becoming clear. It's still terrible and I hope we, particularly the technical community along with political activism, can make move the balance back towards privacy.
* `The Powerball Jackpot Is $425m. Should You Play? <https://medium.com/p/28c5a31cd41d>`_ - James Harvey (Medium). Don't let a little bit of maths dissuade you - this is a great read.

Video:

* Stargate SG1, Season 7. Fighting the Goa'uld System Lords without ever taking themselves seriously. I love this show.

> A decade or so from now, when, say, I’m waiting for my son to come home from college for his winter break, and, when he does, he wants to spend his time going out with his friends — how much will I be willing to pay then to be able to go back in time, for one day, to now, when he’s eight years old, he wants to go to movies and play games and build Lego kits with me

I'm a Dad with young boys and I try and struggle to balance *boy time* with *me time*. This is a lovely reminder of what really matters, a reminder to enjoy this phase of fatherhood, and something that gives hope that I won't always be so constrained with my time.

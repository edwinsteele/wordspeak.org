I've been looking for a place to host my videos in the wake of my move from Smugmug, and I've settled on `Vimeo <http://vimeo.com/edwinsteele/videos>`_. They don't flag my videos as breaching copyright simply because I use a commercial song as a backing track and their interface is nice enough so I'm in.

The software that I use to publish this blog, `Nikola <http://getnikola.com>`_ uses a form of plain text called `reStructuredText <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ to define the contents of the web pages and it didn't have an existing method to display the Vimeo embedded video player... so I adapted the existing YouTube one, and the author of Nikola `integrated it <https://github.com/ralsina/nikola/pull/253>`_. Hooray. One more little step.

So here it is in action, showing one of our videos from our time in the US a few years ago.

The rest of the videos are over at `my Vimeo page <http://vimeo.com/edwinsteele/videos>`_. Hope you enjoy them.

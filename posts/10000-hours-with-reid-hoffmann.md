Ben Casnocha, quoting the LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman:

> "If you aren't embarrassed by the first version of your product, you shipped too late."

Be more aggressive in the features that you cut or postpone in your products, particularly early in their life.

And on being identifying levels of engagement on a project:

> * Principal – You're driving the process. You're the man. You have ball control.
> * Board Member – You're probably an investor. You're regularly meeting with the principal. You're thinking about the project even when you're not formally scheduled to be doing so. You're continually up to speed on the latest and greatest.
> * Investor – You're a supporter (financially or with periodic bursts of time), but you're not actively involved in the project. You'll meet with the principal occasionally. If you're called to do something, you have enough context such that you can be helpful on a reactive basis, but you won't have up to date knowledge.
> * Friend. You enjoy talking to the principal. But the moment you walk away from the breakfast or lunch – that's it. You're not thinking about it anymore.

It's a half-hour read, but it's worth it.

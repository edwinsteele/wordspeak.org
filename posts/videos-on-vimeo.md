I've been looking for a place to host my videos in the wake of my move from Smugmug, and I've settled on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/edwinsteele/videos). They don't flag my videos as breaching copyright simply because I use a commercial song as a backing track and their interface is nice enough so I'm in.

The software that I use to publish this blog, [Nikola](http://getnikola.com) uses a form of plain text called [reStructuredText](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) to define the contents of the web pages and it didn't have an existing method to display the Vimeo embedded video player... so I adapted the existing YouTube one, and the author of Nikola [integrated it](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/pull/253). Hooray. One more little step.

So here it is in action, showing one of our videos from our time in the US a few years ago.

The rest of the videos are over at [my Vimeo page](https://vimeo.com/edwinsteele/videos). Hope you enjoy them.

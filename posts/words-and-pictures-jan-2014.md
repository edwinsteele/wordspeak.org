Building on November's feat of watching a whole film on DVD, my wife and I escaped to IMAX to see something current! Astonishing! Here's the full list of highlights form the month.

Reading:

-   [The Builderâ€™s High](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-builders-high/) - Rands in Repose. There's such joy and satisfaction in creating something.
-   [The NSA and the Corrosion of Silicon Valley](http://allthingsd.com/20131230/the-nsa-and-silicon-valley/) - Michael Dearing. The NSA's activity is hurting US business. I'm actively avoiding using US-based companies where possible because of the US Government's overreach and the NSA's programs.
-   [Command and Control](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6452798-command-and-control) - Eric Schlosser. An engaging look at the controls and technology behind the USA's Cold-War nuclear weapons systems, and the accidents that have occurred with those weapons systems. Having read this, I'm utterly amazed that there has not been a major incident with the US nuclear arsenal.
-   [2014 Gates Annual Letter: Myths About Foreign Aid - Gates Foundation](http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/) - Bill Gates. A long but informative piece, and well worth reading. I'm so glad we have thoughtful, empirically driven philanthropists like the Gates family.

Watching:

-   [Breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_film) - The story behind Robert Hanssen, an FBI agent convicted of spying for the Soviet Union. Ryan Phillippe and Chris Cooper are incredibly good.
-   [Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_(film)) - Seeing this at IMAX was a totally captivating experience. Brilliant.

Recently, I've had a bit of fun combining coffee, programming and geography to plot the locations of single-origin beans that I've tasted in the last year or so.

Here's the result: [Single-origin coffee sources](/pages/single-origin-coffee-sources.html). Note the clustering around the few areas that are [suited for coffee growth](http://www.coffeeresearch.org/agriculture/environment.htm), with Australia as the outlier!

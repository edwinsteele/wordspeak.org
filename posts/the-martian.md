I just finished reading [The Martian, by Andy Weir](http://andyweirauthor.com/books/the-martian-hc) and it was captivating. The Martian is a _Robinson Crusoe on Mars_ cum _Apollo 13_ story full of engineering problems and creative technical solutions with an entertaining monologue. 
It's a physics and chemistry lab-book fused with a personal journal and snippets of a technical design document and I found it to be suspenseful, believable and interesting throughout.

Now, where did those two days go?

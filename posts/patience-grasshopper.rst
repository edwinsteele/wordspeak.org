One step at a time.

I'm always fighting the desire to have everything perfect before even starting
but here I just want enough infrastructure to publish, be happy enough with
the look and have a starting point for improvements.

Here's the basic todo list:

#. Actually get a basic wordpress and gallery2 install [ka-ching]
#. Move the content across from my old zeta site (`http://www.zeta.org.au/~ed`), particularly image galleries and Quicktime VR panoramas [ka-ching]
#. Sort out and upload the rest of the image galleries [done]
#. Upload the first cut at my wordpress template [done]
#. Tie in the wordpress and gallery templates via the wordpress gallery2 plugin [done]
#. Write! [ Now I'm here ]

I've already got several image galleries in place. You can see them by
following the Photos link at the top right of this page.

Cheers,

Edwin.

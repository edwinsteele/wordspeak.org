This month I got stuck in a tome, and I found it hard to leave the office during the day, which meant my lunchtime [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) routine didn't happen very often, which means there aren't so many smaller articles for recommendation this month.

Notable reading:

-   [All Hell Let Loose](http://www.maxhastings.com/2011/all-hell-let-loose/) - Max Hastings. A large and well written book on WW2 events focusing more on government and society than units, movements and generals. The material is excellent and informative but I did not enjoy it, so I stopped about half way through. In another place, with more mental and emotional energy, I would have completed it. I suspect my war reading will remain in the sanitised combat-centric genre, even though Hastings reminded me of the horrific effects of war.
-   [Ain't No Reason](http://the-magazine.org/12/aint-no-reason) - Lex Friedman. Insight into pidgins, creoles, grammar and prescriptive linguists, in the context of African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Articles like this are the reason I keep reading Marco Arment's [The Magazine](http://the-magazine.org) (he's the guy who wrote the Instapaper iPad App that I so regularly use).

Movies:

-   [Skyfall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1074638/). If it weren't for the last 15 minutes and the rooftop bike scene, I'd have forgotten it already. Pithy, explosive enjoyment.
-   [Bullitt](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062765/). Come for the car chase, stay for the cinematography. My only expectations were of the green Mustang Fastback so I was surprised to find myself captivated by the scenes without dialogue and the periods of silence, which reminded me of the amazing safe-cracking scene in [Rififi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048021/). Far more artsy than I expected, and very enjoyable.

Having just loaded a bunch of articles from Longform, and recently added the RSS feed from [The Browser](http://thebrowser.com), I suspect I'll have some prize articles to list next month.

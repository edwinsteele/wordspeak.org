Mt. Kosciuszko is Australia's highest mountain. If you are planning the trip, I suggest you leave behind your supplemental oxygen, your ice axe and your duck-down suit. Your best friend would be a good old can of Aerogard. The flies are really bad.

Between Christmas and New Year's, a friend and I drove from Sydney, past Canberra and up into the Snowy Mountains. After a good night's sleep we continued past the ski fields and drove as far as we could until the road stopped at Charlotte's Pass. 2 hours and a 9km walk later we stood heroically, windswept and a little sunburnt, a full 2229m (7313ft) above sea level surveying all the land and people of Australia beneath us... at least until the next person stood next to the summit marker! Taking a different route back lead us past beautiful alpine scenery, a glacial lake and some wildflowers that grow in one place worldwide -- along the track we walked. The 13km return leg was tiring but ever so beautiful. Take a day out if you're in the area in summer.

Now, would it surprise you that I took photos? Honestly, I'm really thrilled with the way these came out. I'm especially fond of the jpg panoramas. All the photos and jpg panoramas are in my [Kosciuszko](https://images.wordspeak.org/kosciuszko_2005/) album.

Oh, OK. Here's a taste...

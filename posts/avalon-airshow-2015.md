Recently, my wife and I took our boys to the [Avalon Airshow](http://www.airshow.com.au/airshow2015/PUBLIC/index.asp) and we had a great time. We stayed in South Yarra, which had lovely views of Melbourne City.

The food was wonderful too - the best coffee was from Elephant Stamp Espresso (Yarra St, South Yarra), my favourite food was a Kong Pau from Dainty Sichuan (Toorak Rd, South Yarra) that transported me back to Shanghai. My wife loved the Carbonara from [Versachi's](http://www.versachis.com.au).

As for the Airshow, we had fun but the boys ran out of steam before the day was out so we missed out on some close-ups of the combined assault simulation that showed all the Australian Defence Force (ADF) aircraft in action. I saw it at the 2011 Airshow and it's one of the highlights - if you find yourself at an Avalon Airshow and there are ADF planes listed back-to-back on the program, chances are it's one of these simulations and you should make your way forward so you can get a good view.

Here's a few shots to give you a feel for the day. The [whole album is on flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/edwin_steele/sets/72157651169410891/) (23 photos)

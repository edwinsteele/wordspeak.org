The best reading for the month:

-   [Bad Blood: The Life and Death of Alexander Litvinenko](https://medium.com/matter/6cfeae2f4b53) - Will Storr (Medium). Interesting background on Alexander Litvinenko, explaining why he was considered a target for assassination, and the pharmacological workings of polonium-210.
-   [The Death of the Urdu Script](https://medium.com/p/9ce935435d90) - Ali Eteraz (Medium). New technological considerations in language preservation - what would happen if your pen only wrote words with American English spelling?
-   [The White Spider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Spider) - Heinrich Harrer. A classic mountaineering text about climbing the North Face of the Eiger. The first half was very interesting, but the second half was too slow to keep my attention.
-   [Why would I donate my body to science?](http://aeon.co/magazine/altered-states/the-after-life-for-me-is-to-donate-my-body-to-science/) - Brooke Borel (Aeon Magazine). I'm already an organ donor, but this makes me consider going beyond organ donation.
-   [The Slow Winter](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1309_14-17_mickens.pdf) [PDF] - James Mickens. Brilliant and hilarious commentary on the evolution of CPUs. Best of the month. Seriously... it's **that** funny.

I saw [Kottke's year in cities 2006](http://www.kottke.org/06/12/my-year-in-cities-2006) and figured it'd be fun to do mine too:

-   Sydney, Australia (Home)
-   Austin, TX, USA \*
-   Las Cruces, NM, USA
-   Flagstaff, AZ, USA
-   Roswell, NM, USA
-   San Francisco, CA, USA
-   Fresno, CA, USA
-   Yosemite, CA, USA
-   Carson City, NV, USA
-   Canberra, Australia

The rules state: one or more nights spent in each place. Those cities marked with an \* were visited multiple times on non-consecutive days.

Reading:

* `Professor, You're Dividing My Nation <http://chronicle.com/article/Professor-Youre-Dividing-My/139893/>`_ - Sophie Hardach (Chronicle Review). The political complexities in defining a national language (in this case, Kurdish). If you enjoyed the Urdu piece last month, you'll enjoy this too.
* `Pursuing the Platypus <http://idlewords.com/2013/12/pursuing_the_platypus.htm>`_ - Maciej Ceg≈Çowski. A funny and entertaining narrative that introduces you to Australia's native fauna as the author has a holiday in Queensland.
* `Stuxnet's Secret Twin <http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/11/19/stuxnets_secret_twin_iran_nukes_cyber_attack?page=full>`_ - Ralph Langner (Foreign Policy). A very readable technical explanation of how Stuxnet damaged the Iranian nuclear program. (Reading in Instapaper bypasses the free registration requirement)
* `How the Bitcoin protocol actually works <http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/how-the-bitcoin-protocol-actually-works/>`_ - Michael Nielsen. Informative and easy to follow. It's technical, but if you understand public key cryptography and cryptographic hashing, you'll be fine.
* `Threat Vector <http://www.tomclancy.com/book_display.php?isbn13=9780399160455>`_ - Tom Clancy with Mark Greaney. I read this on holidays and had low expectations after seeing Tom Clancy's quality decline in the last decade, but I was pleasantly surprised. The combat sections are top-notch, as usual, but in this case the plot was quite reasonable and not wrecked by unnecessary sex.

Watching:

* `The Amazing Race, Season 23 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Race_23>`_ - After all these seasons, it's still a great way to veg out after work.

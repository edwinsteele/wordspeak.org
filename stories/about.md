Behind the keyboard
===================

I live in Sydney, Australia, and am happily married with three children. I'm a follower of Jesus and am a part of [ImagineNations Church](https://inchurch.com.au) in western Sydney. My day job is in IT Operations but I also love writing software in Python in my spare time.

On the desktop
==============

-   I run MacOS on the desktop (a 15" MacBook Pro hooked up to a Dell UP2414Q 4K monitor) and OpenBSD on servers
-   My current photos are taken with convenient devices, generally my iPad Pro or on my iPhone SE. My older photos were taken on a more traditional format camera, a 3.2mp Canon Ixus IIs, 10mp Panasonic DMC-TZ15 or film Nikon FM2
-   I write text and code in Vim and process photos in Apple Photos
-   I store my source code on [Github](https://github.com/edwinsteele)

On the server
=============

-   This site is built using [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) and is hosted on [Vultr](https://vultr.com)
-   Photo Galleries are built using [Sigal](http://sigal.saimon.org/en/latest/) and are self-hosted at [images.wordspeak.org](https://images.wordspeak.org) and videos are on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/edwinsteele/videos)
-   Source for this site is in my [Github repository](https://github.com/edwinsteele/wordspeak.org)

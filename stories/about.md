Behind the keyboard
===================

I live in Sydney, Australia, and am happily married with two children. I'm a follower of Jesus and am a part of [ImagineNations Church](http://www.imaginenationschurch.com) in western Sydney. My day job is in IT Operations but I also love writing software in Python in my spare time.

On the desktop
==============

-   I do all my real work on a 13" Retina MacBook Pro, and when I'm home it's hooked up to a Dell UP2414Q 4K monitor and an Apple 23" display.
-   My current photos are taken with convenient devices, generally my iPad Air or on my wife's iPhone 4S. My older photos were taken on a more traditional format camera, a 3.2mp Canon Ixus IIs, 10mp Panasonic DMC-TZ15 or film Nikon FM2
-   I write text in Vim, write code in PyCharm and process photos in Aperture
-   I store my source code on [Github](https://github.com/edwinsteele)

Behind the keyboard
*******************
I live in Sydney, Australia, and am happily married with two children. I'm a
follower of Jesus and am a part of `ImagineNations Church <http://www.imaginenationschurch.com>`_ in western Sydney. My day job is in IT
Operations but I also love writing software in Python in my spare time.

On the desktop
**************
* I do all my real work on a 13" Retina MacBook Pro, and when I'm home it's hooked up to a Dell UP2414Q 4K monitor and an Apple 23" display.
* My current photos are taken with convenient devices, generally my iPad Air or on my wife's iPhone 4S. My older photos were taken on a more traditional format camera, a 3.2mp Canon Ixus IIs, 10mp Panasonic DMC-TZ15 or film Nikon FM2
* I write text in Vim, write code in PyCharm and process photos in Aperture
* I store my source code on `Github <https://github.com/edwinsteele>`_

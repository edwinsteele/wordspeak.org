In Summary
==========

No rights reserved. No permission is needed to copy, distribute, or modify the content of this site. Credit is appreciated but not required.

Why?
====

Things aren't meant to control you. What you own shouldn't define who you are, neither should you be defined by your abilities or what you've created. By releasing my writing, my source code and my photos, I've let go and can quit worrying about protecting them, taking credit for them or keeping control of them. They can no longer control me. By releasing control, it's also easier for others to make use of them for their own purposes, and while I might miss out on an opportunity for royalties I'd rather live a freer, less complicated life. Jesus really helped me when he said, "Freely you have received, now freely give" (Matthew 10:9); I've been given a lot, and it's right for me to give back.

More specifically
=================

To the extent possible under law, the author, Edwin Steele, waives all copyright and related or neighbouring rights to this blog, the written contents of the wordspeak.org sites as well as photos and videos hosted on wordspeak.org.

My Flickr photos and videos, and videos hosted on Vimeo have licensing information visible on that sites. All my personal images and videos are labelled as being released under the most liberal licence available on that site, the [Creative Commons Attribution licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) . The few images that aren't mine are labelled as All rights reserved.

That said, you can do whatever you want with my Flickr and Vimeo images and videos. I waive all copyright and related and neighbouring rights to them too - you don't need to give me credit, though it's appreciated if you choose to do so.

Useful resources

The Creative Commons group have made it easy to licence your creations, to whatever extent you're comfortable. I like the [Creative Commons Zero licence](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0) best and there are many more available at <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/>
